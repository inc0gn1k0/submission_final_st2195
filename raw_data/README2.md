#### How to download the raw_data to populate this folder:

1. Download or Copy the Harvard Dataverse .csv files (>12GB of data) into the empty 
/raw_data folder (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7 - there are 26 individual files in 
total, and I advise you download all of them)


2. Finally, navigate to python_notebooks folder and run the 2DBSetup_python.ipynb notebook 
OR navigate to r_notebooks folder and run the 2DBsetup_R_notebook.Rmd notebook to setup 
the comp97to07.db database...
